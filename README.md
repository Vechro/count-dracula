# Count Dracula the Discord counting bot

**Rules**

1. The number has to be the first thing in your message. If you choose to you can add more text after the number as long as it's separated by a space from the number.
2. The number has to be written in text in the base-10, binary (prefixed by "0b") or hexadecimal (prefixed by "0x") format. Both Arabic and Roman numerals are valid.
3. Only one consecutive number per person.
4. No editing/deleting. You may only edit your message if you do not change the number at the start of the message.

**Consequences**

Messing up will temporarily remove your right to count by modifying your permission to write in #counting

**Upcoming features**
* Cap counting to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INT` and other JS limits
* Command for changing rules
* Swap out Moment for Luxon
