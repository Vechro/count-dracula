**Rules**
1. The number has to be the first thing in your message, which can then be followed by a message.
2. The number has to be written in text in the base-10, binary (prefixed by "0b") or hexadecimal (prefixed by "0x") format. Both Arabic and Roman numerals are valid.
3. Only one consecutive number per person.
4. No editing/deleting. [Unimplemented]
5. No breaking on purpose. If you do, you will get expelled from the channel.

**Consequences**
Messing up will temporarily remove your right to count (by assigning you with a role that removes your write access from #counting)
